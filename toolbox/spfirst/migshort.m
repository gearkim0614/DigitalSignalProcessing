% These are the piano key numbers and the corresponding durations for
% the song Minuet in G Major by J.S. Bach.
% This is the short version which should be useful for debugging; a longer
% version is available in the file called mignotes.m
%
% There are 3 matrices defined: TREBLE, BASS1, and BASS2.
% TREBLE(2,N) contains the note and duration information for the treble clef,
% or upper part of the score. TREBLE(2,N) is a 2 by N matrix where the 
% first row is the list of key numbers and the second rows is the list of
% corresponding durations.
% BASS1(2,N) and BASS2(2,N) define the bass clef, or lower part.
%
% A duration of 1 corresponds to a quarter note; a note value of 0 is a rest.
% In this song there are several times when the treble clef has two notes
% together, in these cases the second treble note is actually placed in one
% of the bass clef arrays (where there is an open slot).
%
%  The formatting of this file is designed to make it easy to spot
% which measure the notes are from.
